Here is an example README.md for a Rust project with some key sections and formatting:

# My Awesome Rust Project

This is an example Rust project to demonstrate a nicely formatted README.

## Overview

This project implements an awesome algorithm for doing something very important. It showcases some of the cool features of Rust like:

- Blazing fast performance
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install it from [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

### Installing

Clone the project and build it with Cargo:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/rust-project.git
cd rust-project
cargo build
```

### Running

To run the program:

```
cargo run --release
```

This will build in release mode and execute the binary.

## Usage

The program allows you to do something very useful, like so:

```
awesome-program input.txt output.txt
```

This reads `input.txt`, performs the awesome algorithm, and writes the output to `output.txt`.

## Roadmap

There are some exciting features planned for the future:

- Support for parallel processing
- A HTTP API 
- Integration with databases

See the [open issues](https://github.com/username/rust-project/issues) for a full list of proposed features.
