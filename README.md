# Rust Pytorch CPU|GPU stress test

A sily project to stress test your training processor..

## Overview

This project implements an awesome algorithm for Stress Testing CPU|GPU. It showcases some of the cool features of Rust like:

- Blazing fast performance
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install it from [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

### Installing

Clone the project and build it with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dewasahu/DeviceStressTest.git
cd DeviceStressTest
cargo build
```

### Running

To run the program:

```bash
cargo run -- cpu or cargo run : to put stress on CPU
cargo run -- gpu  : to put stress on GPU
```
